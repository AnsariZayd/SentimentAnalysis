"R37R7CUU8GK3LY","Shiv","Everyone has dreamed of something atleast once in their life, some realize their dreams sooner and some later. But at a certain point of life we abandoned those dreams. Reasons?? We were not trying enough? We were doing our best but still no results? The responsibilities and the people that are holding us back. ""When you want something the whole universe conspires in helping you to achieve it"" quite amusing isn't it? But there are times when everything goes wrong ""When the world shoves you around, you just gotta stand up and shove back. It's not like somebody's gonna save you if you start babbling excuses."" Life is sure great if you have the dreams to chase. Loved the book, go follow your dream try as hard as you can and in the end you will have no regrets.","Reviewed in India on 8 August 2022","A fable about following your dream",4,"","14"

"R7NT9V7G4PA8L","Vallabha Sayar","I received a very high quality product. The cover and hard bind were intact and it looks very fat for a 230 odd page book so the quality of pages is impeccable. It's also a very cute and adorable size, given I have tiny hands.Now the content: The original book has been translated into English and though it doesn't seem like a natural translation, the words do strike the right chords in one's heart.It speaks of philosophical principles such as the universe conspiring to get you what you strongly desire and about understanding the language of the world, which is love. At the surface they might seem well, superficial but everything around us is continuously emitting its own energy and when you're able to read it's wavelength, you really ""understand"" phenomenon around you. The author calls these as omens. Like the camels and the men of desert that speak the language of the desert. It's really a simple and beautiful concept. A nomad in the desert has been observing the desert for eternities and can make predictions about the whereabouts of water the weather at night, etc. In the same way a sailor who sees endless stretches of water every day knows things about the tides, the sun, the rains, the winds and the clouds. This is what the author means by ""communicating with the sun, the clouds, the wind"".The other is about the universal language: love which is also a beautiful concept where two individuals in love seem to ""vibe"" and just get each other. When you're oscillating at similar wavelengths you're more likely to absorb each other's energies.So, long story short, this is a beautiful read that'll put your mind at ease with every page you flip. It's also a book about hope and finding the real treasure. Real treasure is not a lot of gold like the protagonist sets out to search for but your own spiritual self that needs nurturing. And once you get there, you are the Alchemist, everything you touch turns into gold.","Reviewed in India on 18 August 2022","Words that are capable of slowing down your heartbeat",5,"","12"

"R3GHO4AKLGFAR2","Thabresh Syed","The Alchemist is a fantastic book and the storytelling is beautiful.The choice of words are impeccable, full of wisdom and philosophy .I totally loved it .The story is very enchanting and bursts with optimism which I think is very important in our lives .The book shows that the journey to your destiny is as important as the destiny itself.I love how the book emphasizes on the importance of faith,hope and spirituality through the story of an ordinary boy.I think this book appeals to everyone because we all have dreams and sometimes we just want someone to tell us that they may come true.Overall,‚ÄùThe Alchemist‚Äùis a very exciting fiction novel and it deserves a space at everyone‚Äôs bookshelf.Favorite quotes from the book‚ÄúOne‚Äôs Personal Legend(destiny) is what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. ‚ÄúAt that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend‚Ä¶.whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it‚Äôs because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It‚Äôs your mission on earth.‚ÄùPaulo Coelho, The Alchemist‚ÄúTell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second‚Äôs encounter with God and with eternity.‚ÄùPaulo Coelho, The Alchemist‚ÄúIf someone isn‚Äôt what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.‚ÄùPaulo Coelho, The Alchemist‚ÄúLove is not to be found in someone else but in ourselves; we simply awaken it. But in order to do that, we need the other person.‚ÄùPaulo Coelho, The Alchemist‚ÄúOne is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.‚Äù Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist‚ÄúYou can become blind by seeing each day as a similar one. Each day is a different one, each day brings a miracle of its own. It‚Äôs just a matter of paying attention to this miracle.‚Äù Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.‚ÄùPaulo Coelho, The Alchemist‚ÄúThere is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.‚ÄùPaulo Coelho, The Alchemist.","Reviewed in India on 2 March 2020","Finding one‚Äôs destiny or purpose in life :)",5,"",0

"R3699MCHA0NYGR","Amazon Customer",""" IT IS AN INSPIRATION FOR EVERYONE FOR SEEKING THEIR PATH IN LIFE AND REALIZING THEIR DESTINY, AS WELL AS THE ESSENTIAL WISDOM OF LISTENING TO OUR HEARTS""  BY- Bhaskar jyoti Deka, 27 Dec,2016  B.A 1st semester, Darrang college, TezpurAccording to The Alchemist, Personal Legends serve as the only means by which an individual can live a satisfying life. In fact, the universe can only achieve perfection if all natural things continuously undergo a cycle of achieving their Personal Legend, evolving into a higher being with a new Personal Legend, and then pursuing that new goal. This concept, that the individualistic pursuit of a Personal Legend exists as life‚Äôs dominant‚Äîperhaps only‚Äîspiritual demand, lies at the center of the unique theology of The Alchemist. As we see when Santiago must give up his flock and leave Fatima, material success and even love pose obstacles to Santiago achieving his Personal Legend and must be delayed or ignored altogether. Those who put off their Personal Legends, such as the crystal merchant, suffer regret and fail to experience the wealth and other favors that the universe bestows upon those who follow their Personal Legends. In the novel, even alchemy, the central symbol of the book, entails coaxing metal to achieve its own Personal Legend to turn into gold. As a result, the idea that all individuals should live in the singular pursuit of their individual dreams emerges as the primary theme of The Alchemist.In The Alchemist, the spiritual unity represented by the Soul of the World binds together all of nature, from human beings to desert sand. This idea underlies the parallel we see in the novel between the alchemist purifying metal into gold and Santiago purifying himself into someone capable of achieving his Personal Legend. According to the novel, the Soul of the World has created an ultimate desire, or Personal Legend, for everything, whether Santiago or a piece of iron. To accomplish its Personal Legend, each thing must learn to tap into the Soul of the World, which purifies it. That continual purification ultimately leads to perfection. This notion of humans, metals, and all other things sharing the same goal demonstrates that all elements in nature are essentially different forms of a single spirit.Furthermore, over and over again we see that Santiago must communicate with nature in what the novel calls the common language of the world. Santiago‚Äôs horse, for instance, communicates with him by showing him evidence of life in an apparently barren expanse of desert, and Santiago must employ the help of the desert, the wind, and the sun in order to turn into the wind. As the alchemist says when he leaves Santiago, everything from a grain of sand to God himself shares the same spiritual essence. This pantheistic view dominates The Alchemist, and along with the individual, evolutionary theology expressed in the theme of alchemy, it forms the book‚Äôs core spiritual message.THEME OF THE BOOKThe book's main theme is about finding one's destiny. According to me The Alchemist is ""more self-help than literature."" An old king tells Santiago, ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe will conspire so that your wish comes true."" This is the core of the novel's philosophy and a motif that plays all throughout Coelho's writing in The Alchemist.","Reviewed in India on 19 December 2016","""The Alchemist, is an inspiration for everyone for seeking their path in life and realizing their destiny""",5,"",1

"R2F3L3SD7RFWXO","Sanjana Murali","Not everyone dares to follow their dream, even if they do they will have to come across a lot of struggles and failures that blocks their road to their dreams. Paul has given an inspiring wisdom in the form of a simple recipe to all the human beings who have that passion and drive to follow their dreams but are afraid to take that one step forward.The protagonist, Santiago, a shepherd in Andalusia, is described so vibrant in this book, by which one can liven that character. I lived with the protagonist through out the book. I travelled with Santiago from Andalusia in Spain to Egyptian desert in search of a treasure that was dreamed to be buried in the pyramids. We met gypsy women, one who can interpret the dreams than any other. By the wishes from the man who calls himself a king, we decided to cross the sands of the deserts, I even felt the move and shake of the camel. In the desert, we met an alchemist from whom we learned the language of the soul, philosopher's stone and elixir of life. He pointed us to the direction of the quest. Finally, we reached the Egyptian pyramids together to find the treasure and our personal legend. Those that are dismissed as childhood fantasies like the dreams we have, the nature we speak to, the omens we encounter, the people we meet are all the guidance of our inner voice to find our personal legend. We realized. All the characters portrayed in the book had their own purpose to serve in one way or the other to the main theme of the subject.The two core elements which turned the spotlight on are ' Look within yourself you will find all the answers ' - Listen to your heart and "" Transform your dream into reality "".  When the obstacles faced are increased, it means we are just one step beneath from reaching our desired dreams. To achieve the core elements, the protagonist faced a lot of hardship which concludes that an open mind, perseverance and courage can guide us in the right path to success. The other element which is highlighted through out the book is "" When you really want something, the whole universe conspires in helping you to achieve it"". When you are really in need of a life coach, Paulo can give you one through his astounding book, "" The Alchemist "". This book is a discovery of the treasure within. Rich. Vivid. Boundless.I relate this book with this simple line, "" Lost and found on Mars"", because, the treasure is within ourselves, our inner voice is our greatest treasure, we are a great treasure to ourselves. Whatever will happen to you, starts from you. We are our destiny. Be it happiness or melancholy, it is we who create it. We are responsible for our own desires and consequences. Instead of searching the treasure within ourselves, we search it in all the ruined and clueless places. If we look within ourselves patiently, we can find all the treasures in the World. Being a deaf to ourselves is the greatest stumbling block than the truth itself. Now, doesn't the phrase, "" Lost and found in Mars "" makes sense to you? I hope you sense it.","Reviewed in India on 26 May 2015","Lost and found on Mars!",5,"","8"

If you startout by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll lose your desire to work toward getting it.2. When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it3. There were certain things one shouldn't ask about, so as not to flee from one's destiny.4. It's called the principle of favorabilility, beginner's luck. Because life wants you to achieve your destiny.5. You must always know what it is that you want.6. Beauty is the great seducer of men.7. Every blessing ignored becomes a curse.8. The closer one gets to realising his destiny, the more that destiny becomes his true reason for being.9. Wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure.10. It's not what that enters men's mouth that's evil, it's what comes out of their mouths that is.11. When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into the strong current that will carry him to the places ne never dreamt of when he first made the design.12. Fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself.13. When you possess great treasure within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.","Reviewed in India on 14 October 2020","A must read book",5,"",1

There are a fewüòÖ, but the book is really awesome trust me you really won't regret reading it. The book is about a boy Santiago who is a shepherd, wants to follows his dream blah blah blah. This book takes you on a great adventure. Although there is a part which is kind off boring but it's just a small part and you'll really love once you finish it. Don't expect this book to change ur life it's  just a novel with a subtle message on how to pursuit your dreams.Its just like a kind of motivation.","Reviewed in India on 20 June 2021","Just scroll up, order and read",5,"",0
"RM81EKYXXX97M","Ashish Prasad .com","It's not everyday you find an author who's fiction has sold more than 65 million copies world wide and of course one doesn't need to review when the work speaks for itself.But as an English speaker, I could easily see why the author's writing is so disorganised or incoherent - main reason could be that it's been translated from Portuguese. The characters and the story jumps from one setting to another without introducing them prior. It perhaps would have been more annoying to read if this book had more pages added into it. But that being said, obviously, you can't expect much  with the coherence of writing a novel when it has been translated from a foreign language.Getting down to the story itself - The story is about the journey of an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago and his escapades which will involve life's ups and downs along with the priceless rewards life offers for one who stands till the end. Santiago, believing a recurring dream to be of higher purpose, decides to travel to a nearby town to discover its meaning. A gypsy woman tells him that there is treasure in the Pyramids in Egypt. So he starts his adventure which will change his life forever.I've to be honest, it seemed a bit too religious for my liking when I started and I did find myself getting a wee bit bored in the first couple of chapters. But I don't remember at what point, I was hooked on to the book and I finished it in one sitting. Soon after I finished the book, I felt a silence and a sense of awe in me. I consider good writing to be something that offers a positive change and evokes positive emotions. This book did just that bringing back the best of positive emotions- love and hope. In a way, I could say The Alchemist re-ignited my rusty-dreams back into action. There is a lot to learn from the story and it is going to take a bit to process it. I would say you'll need to take the reading lightly - Just read it till the end with an open mind and let the story sink into your subconscious. Whether you like it or not, be assured for a positive change - it will come to you, just keep your mind open.We all take hits in life and we need those things that will trigger all the positive emotions to come back stronger and more alive. The Alchemist is one of those life-altering things.","Reviewed in India on 26 May 2014","A Story Everybody Can Relate To.",5,"","77"

"RNKPRFKLH51I4","Pratyush","I finished reading the book in around 10 days. So I was reading around 15 pages daily.Language- The translation is very simple and easy to understand so avid readers won't have to consult a dictionary from time to time.Material Quality-The book quality is average but it's okay within the price range. The book does contain some advertisements of the other books by the same author.Story-The story centers around a Shepard boy in search of a treasure. The story is set in different places around Europe and Africa. The story is interesting and you want to read one page after another. It has a spiritual touch and atheists and scientific minds(like me) won't find it practical and might not be able to relate themselves to the story.(Like in one case the Shepard boy uses two stones to find the answers to his questions in terms of a yes or no. It looks a bit ridiculous to me. Instead of using stones he should've have consulted a learned person.) There is an importance given to omens. Omens are something which have no scientific explanation so it makes a person like me difficult to believe them. This makes the story boring at times. The story changes dramatically in the last 4-5 pages and after reading the ending I was shivering for the next 15 minutes. It was totally unexpected.Delivery- The book was delivered on time but it was without a bookmark.My opinion- The book is a masterpiece. It must be read by youths. The story is not very lengthy but gives a deep message. Most of the times the story remains interesting and you want to read it further and further. Neglecting the spirituality of the book you will be able to related yourself very well to the story.Overall rating-(including all the points mentioned above)- 4/5 stars.If you like this review please rate it as 'helpful'.THANKS FOR READING","Reviewed in India on 18 August 2016","This review will conceal the inception points of the story and won't break your suspense.

This book is about you, me and anyone and everyone .It is about our life, our troubles and tribulations, our goals and the purpose of our existence. To determine our goal ( or Personal Legend as Coelho terms) and to pursue and achieve it is not difficult if we are focused because in the words of Coelho,""..... when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.""The story is that of a shepard boy named, Santiago ,from Andulasia. The boy embarks upon a journey in search of a treasure that he had dreamt of. Each one of us are, infact, Santiago, unable to realise when and where we spilt 'the spoon of oil '. As you go through the book you learn that all is not lost and there is hope.Narrated in a simple lucid manner,the story is interspersed with metaphors ,fables and allegories. Compelling, interesting and full of hope and positivity, The Alchemist is a bedrock of inspiration that instills a strong sense of faith in yourself.Such is the power of this book that you will want to read it again and again.

"R3DBDF5GPVEI6N","Ashfiya Undre","Book Review : It is my first book that I read of Sir Paulo Coelho, I must say that I am still drooling over it. It is from one of those books which should be read at least once in a lifetime. It will actually change your perspective and your way of living if you are a perciever. You wont be able to categorise this book as per genre because it is part and parcel of everything from self-help, to philosophical fiction to mystery, suspense and what not. The Philosopher`s Stone and The Elixir of Life : These two words have always, will always intrigue me not matter what.And this book served the purpose by clearing my dilemma about the term Alchemist. I am person who would rather choose a Dan Brown or Sci-fi Book or a movie than a Romedy or a Comedy one.  Now here comes what is the book about :  A young Shepherd boy named Santiago, a passionate traveller who thinks there is more to life than what he actually lives with his flock of sheep and his home Andalucia. One day when he realises that the same dream which he has been having constantly is not a mere coincidence but something more fascinating, he gathers up the courage and set the journey of what would be of life-changing consequences. The surreal encounters, unrealistic sights and life endangering decisions teaches him one of the greatest lessons of life and world which cant be seen with any naked eye and an ideal mind which is ignorant of the core element of the World.  I would definitely recommend this to every reader and non-readers too,  as can be of great help for those are lost in life or need some spiritual support and for curious Bibliophiles like me.Thank you","Reviewed in India on 25 October 2016","Overjoyed !!!",5,"","18"

'The Alchemist' offers you some meaningful lessons such as1) people often have this misconception that at a particular instance they have no control on their destiny2)when we clean something we cleanse our soul, we cleanse our negative thoughts3)love always makes you realise your destiny and it always encourages you to achieve your goal. It does not hold you back if it does then it's not your true love.Basically this is  just not the story of the shepherd boy but it's your story also. This is not just a journey of finding treasure but it's the journey of discovering yourself. A must read.","Reviewed in India on 11 February 2019","Loved itüñ§",5,"",0

And with that, it‚Äôs also a book which will teach you a way to lead your life. The inspirational/philosophical books are written in a way which usually makes a reader bore. But the book which has an interesting story to read, and which redefines your soul in some manner is always a worthy read. If you go with the story, this book will show you the way to follow your dream.Here, the Author has narrated the story of an Alchemist who was just like any other boy. While following his dream, he met a woman who interpret dreams, a king who inspires him, an Englishman and finally an Alchemist who helps him in realizing his own worth.While reading, I bet, you can‚Äôt stop turning pages. The 160pages of beautiful writing makes it small and a quick read. And the ending will make you realize what the book is all about.

"R32YGV95R7J8VQ","Harshit Sharma","Well, I finally decided to give in to the peer pressure around this thing. There was an offer and hence, got this via a speedy delivery from Amazon (thanks for that!)Coming to the book.I think the moment you hold it in your hands and notice its appealing cover, you see the ‚Äú65 millions copies sold‚Äù and naturally your expectations skyrocket. Thats what went wrong for me! The people around me, that tag line, they all created a lot of build up around this book.Coming to the reading experience, it is nice to say the maximum. Its not going to touch you, or move up deeply. I mean dont get me wrong here, the narrative is nicely painted. But like many of Paulo‚Äôs work, its a drag, at times. And this short story could have been more crisp.The ending-the last 4 pages- is the real deal of the book. The prior 150 ones are not.Its a good book to read. And I would recommend it to any and all if they are into spiritual books.Thanks.","Reviewed in India on 7 August 2019","Read it and had a decent time doing so.",3,"","4"

"R3R0KHXXGQQHP8","Priyanka M","The Alchemist is a tale that whirls around a certain Andalusian shepherd boy, Santiago, a dreamer, traveller, and enthusiastic learner. The novel is about this boy and how his decisions, hardships he faces, all the things he learns take him to places. And aid him along his path to discover the quest he is on and untangle the mysteries of his recurring dream.Along his way, he meets various strangers who provide him with stories and insights about life and the world. He gains wisdom, courage, and confidence, which at several times helped him to move forward towards his dream.This story provides different takeaways to different people and for me, it was the middle ground as this fable started getting monotonous stating that the entire universe conspires to help you achieve what one desires. All the parts of the story where the author talks about Soul of the World, language of the world and listens to your heart seemed ridiculous while reading. But at the same allows one to be a dreamer and motivates them to learn from their surroundings.","Reviewed in India on 25 September 2021","meaningless read",1,"","5"

"RT0NAUBM3UJWB","Tapas Das","A Dreamer. A Courageous Heart. A Prodigious Journey. A Spiritual Quest. A Gripping Plot. Paulo makes you believe that the dreams of the dreamers can be the actuality of future, whatever that dream is pursue it till the very end. The Alchemist is a beautiful and extraordinarily optimistic tale. ‚ÄúWhen you really want something, the whole universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.‚Äù I think this sums up in a few words what the book is about. From the very beginning you would become a part of Santiago‚Äôs journey. The journey that makes him believe in omens, turns his soul, makes him wise and finally takes him to the treasure.

"R2E23HV60M7A1F","Aradhana Mathews","After hearing about this book for years, I finally got to reading it. The Alchemist is a fairly quick read, using simple but profound prose. The book follows the journey of a shepherd who has the dream of finding treasure among the pyramids of Egypt. His story is filled with words of wisdom from his mentors, so much so that you often feel like you‚Äôre reading life lessons interspersed with a story rather than the other way around.The book is heavily focused on destiny and omens, and the importance of following your calling. I actually found many relatable moments in the book as someone who is attempting to turn their passion into a career ‚Äì the extreme highs and lows that come with success and failure along the way, the ever-present self doubt, the urge to give in to convention and more. I found many of the lessons in the book to be reassuring  (I‚Äôm pretty sure the author would say that choosing this book was a good omen, telling me I‚Äôm on the right path).The book can feel preachy at times, but if you‚Äôre looking for a simple story full of words of wisdom that you can mark and revisit later, you will find this to be an enriching read.","Reviewed in India on 15 September 2022","Deeply philosophical",4,"",0

"R21SUT12096DZR","Ashutosh K.","Bad, bad and very badly written book.Literary content is poor and it never excites you. The story line is jerky and full of moral clich√©s that adds nothing new to your experience. Its popularity can be attributed to the fact that the story tries very hard to invoke senseless morality which is well known and acceptable to the masses. So people with poor taste when read it they are able to think, ""oh yes! he is right. I heard that before. So nice!""I swayed away by the popularity and I promise not to read any Paulo Coehlo book ever in life. I never liked such fable or story books because hardly any author ever met my intellectual expectations. But I thought let's give it a try and it turned out a huge turn off. Also the story line is in the form of third person which I don't like as it disconnects you from the book.Just think of all great statements on morality that people talk in general. Blend it with a childish story of dreams. Here you go the ""Alchemist "" book is ready.Don't buy it you will just waste your money. Since you are here to buy a book I would suggests you to move on before you buy because of some silly reviews of its greatness and number of copies sold. Believe me, the level of language appreciation among population is very bad these days. Also, consider buying the great short stories of Leo Tolstoy also available in Amazon.

"R2ACK9W4MO0XFP","Sivasankar Balakrishnan","I bought the book because of all the great reviews people wrote and because it was recommended by so many people I personally know. I sat down and read the whole book in one sitting hoping to get something useful out of it and feel better after reading it. I got nothing from the book. Absolutely nothing. It didn't make me feel better, enlightened, or glad that I spent those hours reading it. I would not read it again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know.The book has some good ideas in there but they're all tainted with some spiritual new age nonsense. It's not realistic advice and won't help you with everyday life. The story is bearable, but at times waaay too crazy. I can't even compare it to a fable because there isn't an overlying message to the story as with the cute little stories you would have heard when you were little.That being said, if you want to read about a Shepard in some ancient land who goes on an adventure, order the book. If you want advice and some good message, look elsewhere.","Reviewed in India on 5 February 2017","Too much hype for nothing",1,"","6"

In itself is so huge that you wouldn't bother to read reviews before ordering it(Neither did I). But let me tell you a different perspective, I found this book just average. And I don't want to discredit the author for that, I am just saying that teachings of this book may sound very repetitive and outdated. However this is my personal view and I know many genuine people who have read this book will agree with me on this one. But I know this will not stop you from buying this book.

I felt it's just not today;s read maybe back in 1998 people prefer but no not now. Sorcery, religion, magic and all were the preoccupying contents of this book. The worst thing was that the protagonist keep cheering himself reciting the sayings of a so called king that he met. It's just like a literature chapter of the high school which is illicit to publish coz it is too big.

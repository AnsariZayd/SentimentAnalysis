"R1Y6LYA3EVVHII","LibroReview","I personally believe that having a purpose on in life and then giving it your all is the most important to lead a happy life. This book validates so.Ikigai is a short but not very short book based on a Japanese concept. According to this concept, we find the deeply sown purpose of our lives from within ourselves by defining our passion, mission, vocation and profession. It gives you tips as to how the simplest things in our life, like sometimes, taking a pause, are what will give us a long and happy life.I bought a hardcover because of it‚Äôs extremely pretty cover. The cover itself will soothe your mind whenever you look at it. The title does go with the book but personally for me, not as I thought it would.If you are expecting it to help you find your Ikigai, give you step by step solution as to how you can find it and reward it with millions of dollars, you‚Äôll be disappointed. This book is full of facts, real life experience from Japan‚Äôs Okinawa and compels you to focus more on you : your health, your choices, your focus and your inner happiness. It will probably be the only book you‚Äôll come across that tells you to take it, relax, but also burn in your passion.The language is as simplistic and beautiful as the cover and it‚Äôs content. Not many tough words and very beginner-friendly in the reading world. The structure to is great with a prologue, 9 chapters, an epilogue and a list of more suggestions for you to explore in the end.Coming to the overall feel of the book, it‚Äôs very cozy. In it‚Äôs own way, it also does help you slightly to find your own Ikigai.I thought it would be a full on hustle kind of book but I felt relaxed after this read. I was ready to take on my tasks stress-free. Though it is not something extremely crazy and different, it definitely is a one-time read for all the hustlers or non-hustlers out there who think they have to punish themselves to get what they want.","Reviewed in India on 8 April 2019","The best book to read during your break time.",4,"","466"
"RZ17BL1V03BLO","Shravan","üëçüèæ:1. The cover design is really cool and the texture feels too good when you hold it.2. It‚Äôs a good read no doubt about it but I have seen many celebrities posting as if it‚Äôs one of a kind, but it isn‚Äôt.3. Looks lit in your insta story as you can see in the pic xDüëéüèæ:1. The book feels like a plain report summary at many places and there‚Äôs lack of artistic approach towards writing thus fails to capture our attention.2. Some concepts are explained with real examples(mental illness related) which can get bit uncomfortable and unnecessary to read if your are already happy in your life.3. The chapters on how to perform yoga or other forms of exercise feels like a manual reading and not at all effective.4. The book is not for those who want to explore happiness but it‚Äôs for those who wants to live long like 80+ xD5. The text book kind of material in some chapters that talks about our diet felt like a collection of articles and fails to make a point.I hope this helped you.","Reviewed in India on 3 October 2022","Overrated book considering the hype",3,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71p90mf2+rL.jpg",0

"R9QMYPSIX1FPV","Nalin Rai","The title of the book suggests that it is unravelling The Japanese Secrets to a Long and Happy Life, but it also does incorporate the key elements from Indian way of life i.e.Yoga and the Chinese way of life i.e. Tai Chi. Indeed the key point that emerges from the book is that one should keep on moving and not spend most of the time of the day either sitting or lying down.It also dispels the notion that one should start withdrawing from the activities after one is officially retired and advocated that staying active is what would be the deciding factor if one aspires to complete a century on this planet- which incidentally is a Japanese quote from where the book starts. Does it not seem so pertinent in the times that we are living in- the Corona times. IKIGAI actually means living a meaningful life. Though Japan is a major rice growing country, the book advocates drawing from the patterns of food from people residing in Okinawa in Japan is that the food plate construct on a daily basis should be dominated by vegetables and Tofu,  and there is a particular emphasis on the size of the plate. The plate should not be large, as we normally have in Indian conditions but it should be of medium size.However  one may be hungry, one should aspire to eat 80% only which is called as Hara hachi bu in Japanese and were we to follow the maxim it would take care of quite a lot of health related issues that we are confronted with, associated with over eating.Interestingly enough Japanese have been practising the concept of saving called as Moai-where farmers get together to share best practices and also help one another with meager harvests. In the times of distress that the farming community is in the country, can we aspire to have such kind of a group of farmers. Farmers Producers Organizations have been formed but they need to converge to the concept of Moai to make it really effective.This group also had the provision of a monthly contribution akin the idea of SELF HELP GROUPS with a difference that the contribution is utilised for social activities and left over from the contribution is given a member based on his requirements.The book has tried to assimilate other such initiatives from around the world but the bottom line is that one has to find flow in everything that one is doing.  There should not be any distraction or multi-tasking at all as it does not help anyway. To attain the flow, the authors have requested to adopt the policy of leaving the cell phones one hour before going to sleep, and one hour after getting up. Tough act to adopt? Each one of us has a passion inside us or the Ikigai and if we have found it we need to practice and fine tune it, and if not yet, it is incumbent upon us to discover it.NALIN RAI","Reviewed in India on 9 April 2020","Be Slow and Things would fall in Place",5,"","2"

"R1UBTG8KT7NWOZ","Anukriti","To be completely honest I bought this book just because of its cover. I mean just take a moment and observe it, the perfect shade of blue with white flowers. Simplicity at its best. This book has some sort of vibe, I still remember how I smiled when I opened the amazon parcel and found this bundle of positivity and happiness. The sheer pleasure of caressing its pages which is very different as compared to the regular pages of other novels, it gives you immense relief Idk how and why, but it does. Coming to the main content, the book starts by telling the meaning of Ikigai i.e.,purpose of your life, reason to get out of your bed every morning happily and how finding your Ikigai will lead to a long and happy life. The importance of society and a friendly neighbourhood is well put.The interviews of the Japanese Centenarians explains why they are the longest living human beings on this planet, they do the simple activities like gardening also with full enthusiasm, they aren‚Äôt spending their retirement resting on an arm chair instead they attend Karaoke nights, indulge in group activities, sell their produce in vegetable market and believe in eating simple and exercising.They live in present and enjoy every moment happily. Because being aware of the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad; it should help us love the present and those who surround us.'ü¶ãOur Ikigai is different for all of us but one thing we have in common is that we are all searching for meaning. There is no perfect strategy of connecting with our ikigai. But what we learned from the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it. Like the author said ‚ÄúLife is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you‚Äù. The simplest things are often the most beautiful, and this book is the perfect example of this statement. ' Eat right, exercise, and do what makes you happy'...by following this motto, we can definitely find our 'ikagai', our reason to live.","Reviewed in India on 23 August 2020","The Best Things In Life Are Simple !",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714nlI84ZKL.jpg","20"

"R3AJHN9P4AV7XC","Shilpa bhatia","Ikigai came to me at a moment when I was feeling distracted and lost from my ultimate goal. Also, I really feel sad to see my 75 plus mom in law and 65 plus mom to see sticking to bed and complaining that they are good for nothing now. I don‚Äôt want to be one of these old women who can‚Äôt rejoice life anymore, I wish to have both mental and physical strength in my old age too that‚Äôs why I have entertained Yoga to my daily routine.The book starts with Japanese proverb ‚ÄúOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years‚Äù and it touches the art of staying young while growing old and also shares antiaging secrets. It also recommends to find flow in everything you doand master longevity. It gives a comparison of logotherapy of psychotherapy and prefers the previous. Apart from that, the book also tells the experience tales of centenarians as how they made it upto living longer and healthier life. The diet and exercise carry an essential ingredient in a perfect recipe of life.‚ÄúNana Korobi Ya Oki/ Fall seven times, rise eight‚Äù is the key to remain antifragile and be resilient to deal with the setbacks. Follow the philosophies of Budhism and Stoicism which aim at practicing well being while you are enjoying life‚Äôs pleasures. According to stoicism, we should be able to control our emotions and curb our ego and negative emotions.I even loved the ‚Äòwabi sabi‚Äô and ‚Äòichi-go ichi-e‚Äô concepts which tell us that instead of looking for beauty in perfection, we should look out beauty in the given things-the things  that are incomplete and temporary.Although the content on Yoga is something I just skipped because these were known facts and considerations.On the whole, Ikigai is a beautiful gift to the society. It leads you from darkness to light and follow a right path to healthy lifestyle. Worry less, Walk an extra mile and Weigh your burdens less. A good diet and some sort of exercise is needed to be added. Above all, everyone must have some purpose in life. It is the reason to live ‚Äòikigai‚Äô and not anything else,  which keeps you going. The authors Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles stress on never retire policy so as to stay young inside.","Reviewed in India on 16 April 2020","A Fresh Start",5,"","6"

And the concept of Ikigai (the art of living) explains as to finding our purpose, our need to stay healthy, a balance with our emotions and how we live.The book contains 9 chapters which try to explain Ikigai, anti-aging secrets, logotherapy, finding flow in everything we do, longevity with lessons from those who lived the longest, lessons from Japan's centenarians, the Ikigai diet, some basic exercises and movements to practice.I find this book quite practical and full of wisdom.And as for what to take from reading such self-help books, I try to grasp the concept through their contents which are backed up with basic examples and references.

"R3CCLLV5U2N1MJ","Vyoma Hadkar","I started reading Ikigai, the book by Hector Garcia and Frances Mirales. It is a really short book but so profound when it comes to the real reason why Okinawans from Japan live the longest. They are called super centenarian. They eat about 18 varieties of food every day, the move a lot basically do a lot of gardening and walk and lot of community work, and drink a special kind of tea made from local fruit. They also do radio taiso exercise of basically five minutes. More importantly, the book talks about doing what you love to do. When you are one with your activity and your concentration is high that means you are in flow and very few people can do that - to maintain the flow is the challenge. It is basically all that you give to a given moment whether you do yoga, or look after a baby, cook for your family, nurture your plants... you are one with that moment and that if you repeatedly do, that gets you in flow. The book is full of interesting examples that keep you turning the page and in my case swiping left.

I am really happy to have this book in my kindle bookstore. This book is a must read to those who are keen readers of Self help books or those who want to learn a culture, lifestyle and more about Japan. Japan is one of my favorite destinations and so this book was one of my must buy books. The author has given lots of information about the Centenarians, what they eat, how they work, the style they live and what keeps them so alive till the age of 100 years. It is so thrilling while reading this book, that anyone who is fond of Japanese people will love to read and follow their routine style. It has mentioned about the Yoga that is originated in India. The readers will get lot of useful information and you will imagine those great people who have made it up to 100 years with all the enthusiasm and  passion towards their life.","Reviewed in India on 3 September 2020","Ikigai is a must read book and on your bookshelves.",5,"","6"

"RXN84XXTUY3YS","Ankita2020","This book is very different from the too technical ones already present out there on the same topic. Ikigai (book) was like a flow, exactly like the flow which it asks us to find in our lives. It is very crisp and to the point.It's talks about few things we already know but need to be reminded. Things we have learnt or heard of on the way of life, but all those needed to be collected in one place and this book is that place. We humans, in this current age, are running behind things without any meaningful outcome. But somewhere we had to be reminded that this is not what makes a happy life. And this is that reminder. Search for ikigai begins where the book ends.üôÇA quote from the book: ""Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you.""It's no doubt a must read for everyone.

"R2MB2VWW5WVGI2","Alok Kejriwal","Ikigai - Book reviewA pure GEM. Short (1 hour to finish), massively impactful & UPLIFTING.Ikigai is a Japanese concept, which means ‚Äúthe happiness of always being busy"". It explains the extraordinary longevity of the Japanese, especially on the island of Okinawa, wherethere are 24.55 people over the age of 100 for every 100,000 inhabitants!What I LOVED about the book is a reiteration of FACTS that we all know. Best ones:- Never RETIRE. (If you have recently retired parents who are grumpy & throw tantrums, give them this book)- Stop eating JUST when you are about to get full. ‚ÄúHara hachi bu"" means something like ‚ÄúFill your belly to 80 percent.‚Äù- SLEEEEEP!!! Top models sleep a lot!- How to handle thoughts, emotions, BOREDOM. Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh, who would say, ‚ÄúHello, solitude. How are you today? Come, sit with me, and I will care for you.‚Äù- A list of different Japanese meditations & practices.- The Pomodoro Technique to FOCUS : Get yourself a kitchen timer & commit to working on a single task as long as it‚Äôs running.If you want a long, fulfilling life, get this book.","Reviewed in India on 3 November 2019","If you want a long, fulfilling life, get this book.",4,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GFLJ6tHYL.jpg","14"

I was expecting that this book would detail more on the venn diagram illustrated behind the book to find our real purpose in life, but I was a little disappointed when this book was more inclined towards the secrets to life over a 100 years. It is true that the title is specified as 'Japanese secret to a long and happy life', but this book focuses more on the 'long' part than the 'happy' part. To a person who believes that life is meant to be larger and not longer (like me) , this book might turn you off. Also most of the contents in this book quote statements and anecdotes from other books.

The information provided are useful however not detailed. There are references to other literature where detailed information can be found if one wishes to explore them. I found the title a bit unrelated to the content. The book starts with the ikigai concept but explores other areas of general well being and longevity.

Ikigai is a Japanese word, translates to ‚Äú the happiness of always being busy or engaged‚Äù.  The people of Okinawa live a simple outdoor life, drink green tea, and eat a healthy diet served in a special bowl that limits to their eating. The book explains that every being has an Ikigai, a journey of self-discovery and it‚Äôs worth the search. Ikigai draws attention to the lifestyle of Japanese people showcasing how they lead an optimal healthy life, filled with happiness, and longevity. The main focus is on diet, daily activities and a sense of joy. It also includes wisdom from supercentenarians(above the age of 110) from all over the world.Every individual's Ikigai is different but the search is common.

"R353MEFFMHYAY8","Short of a Century","The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.The book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.The chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.I was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.The hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture. Inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge. The font size is good. The spine as well as pages hold up well. Overall, the book is quite light and sturdy.

"R1VE34KI2CIY9P","Read with Taran","Ikigai is a Japanese concept that means your 'reason for being. ' 'Iki' in Japanese means 'life,' and 'gai' describes value or worth.The book Ikigai is all about finding your life's purpose. It is about striking the balance between passion, profession, mission and vocation. This in turn leads to happiness and longevity. In many ways I felt the book reaffirms our learnings from Viktor Frankl's Man's Search For Meaning. Somehow, I felt the latter part of the book can be skipped as it is a jumble of things we come across in various other books. Even though the book in many places is redundant and repetitive, it has many nice takeaways from it.Of these I loved the Ten Rules of Ikigai which pretty much summarize the Ikigai way of life:‚òëÔ∏èStay active.‚òëÔ∏èDon't retire‚òëÔ∏èTake it slow‚òëÔ∏èGet in shape‚òëÔ∏èLive in the moment‚òëÔ∏èReconnect with nature‚òëÔ∏è Smile‚òëÔ∏èSurround yourself with good friends‚òëÔ∏èGive thanks‚òëÔ∏èFollow your Ikigai","Reviewed in India on 8 October 2022","Nice but goes astray from the objective",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yP+ftOlbL.jpg",0

"RIM0DTZ8XK17B","SnoopyDa","A cleverly marketed book with a catchy cover that opens your pocket easily...But having read it, i must say that the content and the treatment of the theme or subject is very shallow. For a naive reader the material may appear nice with a diverse variety of Japanese terms sprinkeled all over. References to a whole lot of thinkers, writers adds to the charm.But the whole plot falls apart when it leaves youbwanting for more. This book is like a buffet of tiny little dishes from multiple cuisines. You get to sample them but thats it.Some examples cited are also ridiculous, for instance, the authir says that for years after the 2011 Tsunami that devastated Japan, the market boomed for Japanese construction companies. That according to the author makes those companies ""anti-fragile"", meaning something that gets stronger when harmed.  I dont get it at all. The tsunami did no direct harm to the construction companies so one is unable to appreciate how they got stronger after the calamity.If an occasional sprinkle of terms like Wabi-Sabi, Ichi-go, Ichi-e, hari-hachi-bu, mabui, tai chi, qigong and so on excite you - pick it up.The book really leaves you craving for more, an experience like when you order a full meal but are served small portions as if it was a side dish.","Reviewed in India on 12 November 2019","Very shallow content",3,"",1

The epilogue nicely summarises the entire premise of the book.The bad part  the book are those sections which seems to promote pseudo-science when it comes to discussing diet and the benefits of certain types of food items. I will be the last person to take those things by face value. Also, the book described the lifestyle of the centenarians as if they were living that way their whole life (singing, dancing, tending to their garden), which is simply not true.

"R2FQU020E2TY9I","gaurav","I found it more like a wellness blog. I bought this book after coming across the IKIGAI venn diagram shared in an online session about life's purpose. The diagram explores 4 vocational elements namely what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs and what can be paid for. The idea is to choose a career that qualifies on these 4 elements. I bought the book to explore more about this concept. But the book is not about the diagram, it is about general principles of a happy and long life that are practiced in a small town Okinawa in Japan. It is a good read but my expectation were a lot more. I later did some search and came across this link that says the the creator of the diagram is not even a Japanese and had only listened to a ted talk about IKIGAI. This is a weird world. Anyway, can't discredit the book, it is a good read but know that it is not about the diagram that helps you choose a right career.","Reviewed in India on 15 November 2020","This book is not about choosing the right career",2,"","3"

"R17T8S0M9PVZ8E","Khushi jha","In the middle of me reading and enjoying this book, I recommended it to a cousin who's having doubts on herself in her new job, and some amount of anxieties about getting older. She replied with evident apathy, saying she'd had enough reading similar books, implying her doubt this book wouldn't be different. I have to admit there are many concepts, facts, and quotes we might have heard many times from consuming other sources before, but Miralles and Garcia offer invaluable new insights that stretch wide, that would inspire us to keep trying to be a better person, and eventually to live life to the fullest by having a purpose. A unique and real one that we've had since birth, that we're meant to discover if we haven't. Rather than becoming apathetic after my cousin's comment, I finished this book feeling really grateful for this book having found me, and getting even more convinced I won't stop reading self-help and inspiring books, because everyone needs a reminder every now and then anyway.","Reviewed in India on 9 August 2022","The most important book to actually know to live a healthy and happy life.",5,"",0

"R2LYKHFGZWSYDL","Andy","¬†Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.1) Large Curved  Display in this price category - 1.69 inch2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby  while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.7) BT Music Control, Weather ‚òÅÔ∏è update and Alexa are other usable smart features.8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.2)  Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40  seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer.  In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while  traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.Few  other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :1) Torch üî¶ - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.2) Remote shutter button for camera.3) Call silencing option could have been added.","Reviewed in India on 12 August 2021","Best Budget watch",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/D16MmYsiBAS.jpg

"R1ZQQKZCCG4KD2","archit","Review OverviewAverage2.7The Boat today launched the ‚Äò Boat Xtend ‚Äò, the company‚Äôs latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of Rs. 2,999. The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch. Moreover, it has built-in Amazon Alexa support, SpO2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. Coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? Should you buy this smartwatch? If you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.ContentsBox ContentDesign, Build & ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy Now:Box ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in black&gold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign, Build & ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.Boat Xtend design and buildI personally don‚Äôt like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don‚Äôt look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.Boat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.DisplayComing to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won‚Äôt notice the bezels, and the screen quality won‚Äôt feel cheap at all. It doesn‚Äôt have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.Boat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn‚Äôt something that we can complain about in this price range.Watch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn‚Äôt much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won‚Äôt find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that‚Äôs why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won‚Äôt find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won‚Äôt prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won‚Äôt be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won‚Äôt be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven‚Äôt noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don‚Äôt find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn‚Äôt like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.","Reviewed in India on 17 May 2022","NOt worth the money",3,"","201","Pitch Black"
"R1OHAWNCB4K26S","Arjun Sen","Pros:1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. Large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. Training, Sports modes r good.13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.14. Find my phone works well.15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.Cons:1. Lacks vibration intensity control.2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor.","Reviewed in India on 16 December 2021","Good budget smart watch with Alexa",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51TgRH5KnjL.jpg

But its still overpriced because these functions are available with other brands with lower range. I bought for 2999. So depends on you.Works fine even in dusty or heavy rainfall. Belt quality is really sturdy. Screen glass is very good quality, almost many times I hit railings or equipments. I work in such environment. No scratches at all.I'm satisfied with the tracking and sensors.

Memory for watch faces is limited to less then 10. everytime you need a new watch face you have to download in mobile app (you have to remove the last one you have installed to down load new). you can not just browse on the watch for watch faces and select the one you want. (only 7-8 faces available at a time). Also default watch faces can not to deleted to have all 7-8 faces of your choice. This is irritating.

"RWUHIVJSBP001","Debarya Ghosh","I have received this product a couple of days ago and now I am going to give an honest review of it.This product is a great item if you are looking for a budget smartwatch. For its price, it provides quite accurate measurements of your BPM, stress, SPO2 etc. I have verified it's measurements with an actual oximeter and it proved to be accurate. However, the pedometer of the watch randomly adds around 100 steps. The pedometer is accurate otherwise.The touch display of the 1.69"" watch impressed me. The watch has a sharp display, and smooth touch, which makes you feel like you are on a smartphone. The response time is quite well too. However, the animations lag which is not very eye pleasing, but workable.The battery is great. The watch would be powered on for one whole night and would not lose a single percent of battery. Even while using, it loses a reasonable amount of power. For first time users, who just received their product: You might notice the battery is draining extremely quick. Do not panic. It is recommended to charge the battery for at least 2 hours before first use. It stabilizes the battery. The next time you use your watch, it would work as normal.The built-in Alexa is perhaps my favorite feature of this watch. It's response time is around 5 seconds, and is quite fun to use a virtual assistant on the go. It can tell you facts, jokes, weather, calculations, translations and loads of other stuff, which might be useful for quickly looking up something. However, Alexa does not have a speaker. It gives a text output. The text output can sometimes end with ""..."" (ellipses) which mean the output is too long to print. It can also fail to provide relevant output at times.You need to log in to Alexa with your Amazon account in the boAt Wave App.There are 100+ watch faces in the wave app, which you can use to customize your watch with whatever that suits your personality. You can even use your own pictures. However, you cannot customize the time font if you choose to do that, which, in my opinion, is quite limiting.Notifications in the watch is pretty cool, and comes in handy when you do not wish to open your phone for it. Call alerts come, and you can reject them but not accept. Makes sense as the watch does not have a speaker. It vibrates.It has a good build quality and is water-resistant.Other cool features are sleep tracking, breathing exercise, alarms, timers, flashlights etc.Overall, a pretty decent watch if you are looking for something in this range of price.","Reviewed in India on 7 May 2022","More than what you pay for",4,"","8","Sandy Cream"

Maybe give or take 10 steps->Same with the calorie tracker. It seems to calculate it in a different way than the fitbit I had originally->Music controller doesn't display the name of the song playing, only sound changing, pause/resume, forward/backward->Can only decline calls, cannot attend calls or speak.-> Alexa will show answers on the screen,will not read out the answerOverall, I would say this was a good buy.

I find the level tracking much more accurate than some other budget smart watches, You can also view your calls, messages, whatsapp and other social media notifications. It also has built in Alexa. It has good display screen and what i absolutely love about this smart watch are the wonderful watch faces available to choose from.

You can get to know who is calling you and u can cancel the call.2. You can control play or pause music through watch while in workout modes3. You can read what‚Äôs app message and normal text. And also social media messages.4. DND works gud while sleeping.5. Customised watch face is a brilliant option.6. The features are almost accurate.7. Fitness modes are quite sufficient.8. Build quality and charging is gud9. Battery life I get around 5 days normal use.The cons:1. You can read photo messages sent through what‚Äôs app, it can be understood it‚Äôs screen size is too small for it. Not exactly a con but yes it‚Äôs a lag.2. You can‚Äôt receive a call through watch , you get cancel button but not receive button.3. Find your phone doesn‚Äôt work on iPhone.4. Alexa is just a name sake.5. Software needs lot of development.6. By default u don‚Äôt get notifications on you need to do some research and turn on . No instructions given.7. Service will be pathetic because I have lot of boat products , service center ppl will take a life to service ur product.Overall at the price rs 1985 I feel it‚Äôs gud.

So far experience is very good with the product though sometimes feels the touch to wake up is a bit slow. SpO2 and heart rate measurements looks ok to me; similar values I get from a pulse oximeter. Similar is stress. I am not stressed now and the watch shows Normal range.App download and connection was smooth. Similar with Watch face download and change too. Yet to try sleep tracking.I hope long-term performance too would be great.Update after two days use:So far no performance issues. BPM and SpO2 values in line with pulse oximeter readings. Looks like stress readings are also ok, though I don't know how it is measured. Similar with sleep monitoring.7 Jan 2022. Ordered replacement. The step counter was unreliable, it was not counting all the steps. Some times, after walking 500 steps ( I counted it!), only about 250 steps were added to the total. Sometimes it is very accurate in counting.Got replacement on same day. However, this one too has problem with counting of steps. I think in a day about a thousand steps may not be counted. Will verify again for next couple of days. If not satisfied, planning to return.Other functions are ok.Decided to return as the steps counter is not reliable.","Reviewed in India on 1 January 2022","Thought a Good product",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hwEKM7g+L.jpg","4","Pitch Black"

"R2XPCD0VNMEJVF","Arun","Here is an update after using it for nearly 2 months now.The 14 Sports Mode given in this watch is just for the sake of having one.  This doesn't even detect when one is Cycling.  Only Running & Walking is getting detected and nothing else.  There is no option for us to activate these Sports activity manually too.As mentioned below, the Calorie calculator, KMS done etc., are not that accurate,Battery life is very average as it hardly lasts for 2 days per full charge.Sleep monitor also doesn't give a perfect sleep analysis as was described.Above Feedback submitted to Boat team also via email, but yet to have their response.Used it for about 10 days now ...Step counter is more or less good.Calorie calculator and KMS done is not accurate and has much variations compared to an Apple device.BPM and SPO2 are just for fun I guess as these readings are not even in the range when compared to the readings of an actual BP reader and Oxy meter.Message notifications,  Music üéµ controls are good.Battery lasts for about 3 days on 24/7 use.Has a variety of Faces and Alexa is a plus and kids enjoy these.Touch screen response to be improvised a lot.Temper glass isn‚Äôt recommended as this will further affect the touch response.Wake Gesture sometimes responds very slow.","Reviewed in India on 20 March 2022","It‚Äôs just like another Rs. 999 product ...",3,"",0,"Sandy Cream"

"R6GTDZJWTGSJQ","Ashok","Thanks to Amazon for quick delivery of the smartwatch. The packing etc was nice. However I could not connect the watch to the boat Wave app on my i phone 7 Plus and hence it could not be paired with the App. My Bluetooth setting shows that it is already connected to some other device ""YB"" which is to be turned on and be in the range for pairing. Thus it seems to be an used watch. Unless it is disconnected from earlier device it can not be paired with my phone. As I am unable to use it, I have no comments about its various features except it is a nice looking watch. I have requested Amazon for replacement and Amazon has agreed to replace it. I hope that I will get a new piece in the replacement and I will be able to pair the watch with my phone and use it.

"R2YE8UTAEPHGRL","Kumaar","Been almost a month using this. Have purchased on 30th March 2022 at 2499. Needless to say this smartwatch is truly the best at this prize range (have purchased at 2499/-).Positive sides:No issue with notification, whether it's a call/ message/ WhatsApp message/ mail, it notified in a perfect manner without lag.N.B. To those who can't see the notifications after syncing, pl do check whether DND MODE is turned on or not!Sleep data, Spo2, heart rate, stress data are more or less accurate (with a slight %error while being measured with medical equipments).Sedentary alert is a great option which makes me remind to walk a few steps in between a long work session.Negative sides:Auto sport recognition feature is not that strong, it takes a while to identify while you're on a walk. But if you pre-select the outdoor/indoor walk option, it works fine.Same with the wake gesture button, with the slightest movement of hand, it gets triggered.And finally what I felt, it is not possible to wear 24*7 times a day on the same hand, as it leaves marks on the wrist, and it itches too after wearing for a prolonged period.Overall, it is a good purchase, I'm satisfied.","Reviewed in India on 20 April 2022","Best smartwatch under budget",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DCvRHWi1L.jpg",0,"Pitch Black"

"R36M4WXYKKPSTT","VikIsHere","¬†Honest Review by Vik:I have purchased this watch after so much thinking. I checked the same watch at jio store as well and there the price was 3000. But I changed my mind and was searching on Amazon the price at that time was 2999.But before 26 Jan 2022 I saw a drop in the price to 2200. So I thought to buy it because if I go to buy a Chinese watch. It also cost me around 2100. And it doesn't come with a single minute waranty.Where as boat is a brand that's growing very fast and it also gives 1 year warranty.So I purchased it and after using it for few days, please find my below findings1. This watch gets charged to 100 %  in approximately 2 hour.2. The battery lasts around 3 days max with full use.3. The oxymeter, blood pressure and hear rate sensors works very accurate including the stress monitor4. The indoor and outdoor walking steps are very accurate when counted it matches.5. Very Easy to connect watch with mobile app.6. There are 100s of watch faces you can change to and even you can use your own face customised watch face directly from camera or gallery.7. Charging socket is magnetic, hence easy to connect to watch.8. Strap is so comfortable that you won't feel it like removing even when you are sleeping and the best part here is that it gives you the statistics for how many hours you had a sound sleep.","Reviewed in India on 23 January 2022","Honest Review: Excellent watch with good battery backup",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619Pkkm8teL.jpg","28","Pitch Black"

This watch pairs with VERYFIT app and it completely resembles boat app. Every boat watch is rebranded that's why they have different app for different watches.Keeping this aside, Watch is good looking and also comfortable on wrist. Display is sharp and visible in sunlight. Accuracy at this price range is okay. Some basic features which make a watch ""SMART"" are Missing like camera shutter, Call silent feature and showing the song name in music function. Battery life is 3 days with moderate use which is Average for a smart watch at this price range. GPS in app is not working well. Step count is very accurate and also distance it measures while walking is also accurate. While cycling GPS was not working well. Watch face are not enough and most of them seems childish. Alexa feature is Hit or Miss.Better go with Noise colourfit ultra or Realme 2 pro(I know realme is Chinese product but it's still better than this increasing budget and get better product than this) or buy mi band for fitness activities.

"R3DDVUE10LE63H","Rajkumar","Overall review about the smartwatch is that this fulfills all my expectation, and I see few extra features also got added which makes not to take phones for few basic things such as alarms, timer, stop watch and controlling the music. Overall watch's performance also decent, no slow or lag observed while using it.Initial setup was frustration free, I could easily pair my watch to the boat app by scanning the 2D QR code.specifically calling outAlexa Voice AssistantPersonal experience:Alexa is not at all working, I tried multiple times linking and unlinking amazon account but no hope for Alexa to work.Watch Display:With the increased screen size of 1.69"" inches in boAt Xtend is a  welcome change, now the display looks more attractive and stylish. The screen widgets in watch faces are looking crisp and clear. Also the values from health check apps also pretty clear to see. Display is super smooth and active, no lags or sluggishness observed while touching or swiping the display while accessing it.watch facesIn addition to the existing watch faces, introduction of new watch faces gives big ""WOW"". I could adjust the watch faces according to the current usage, basic or sports watch facesAutomatic screen brightness is pretty useful, it automatically adjust the screen brightness according to the environment which helps in saving the battery without draining unnecessarilyStress monitor is really a useful application integrated on the watch itself, being an IT gut don't want to mention my stress level. This will be really helpful in stress situations.boAt Xtend becomes all in one device, now I can have  my health related data from my watch, need not to buy a separate oximeter or pulse meter. Just a swipe on the display brings the options in a fraction of second.Introduction of various sports modes is really a great thing, being a sports person I can set the sports mode accordingly, personally I liked this one very much.","Reviewed in India on 24 July 2021","Smart watch at its best!!",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KnT8InsLL.jpg

And no matter whatever your complain or concern is, they will do only one thing, they will initate a replacement request without understanding your real problem.So my watch got replaced with another one but they returned different color. I again raised the request so they again attempted to replace.

"R1PECYEHU8TCFK","Tejas Mane","This watch offers good features. You will get to know about the features and tracking accuracy on YouTube so let me tell you some of its major flaws.1. Very laggy touch screen2. App is worst and not compatible with Google Fit.3. You have connect the watch by opening the app. Watch will not auto connect after turning on the bluetooth.4. You can use Alexa only if watch is connected to your phone. It is a good feature if you have smart home devices otherwise only use of Alexa is to set alarms and reminders. Plus it takes some time to actually start listening and respond.5. After new update, watch frequently restarts after doing certain operations like opening alarms or setting up watch faces. It's so annoying and you have to reconnect watch after every restart.After 2 months use, my opinion is to consider this watch only at price point of 2k-2.5k.

Screen Brightness is good. I used it in sunlight and it was fairly visible. Colour combination of Blue and Red looks beautiful.Battery is amazing, I charged it 100% on first day and it still has 68% ++battery after 3 day of use. I'm sure it will last 6-7 days easily.Notification was quick in watch than in mobile, I received notifications on watch even before it comes on mobile. In Call notifications you get option to decline it right from your watch if you can't receive at the moment.Watch has DND mode which is good for your sleep, so remember to switch it on before you go for bed.It has find my phone feature, in case you can not figure out where you left your phone, it can make your phone ring loudly.Strap quality is good, you can also buy new straps and replace it. Removing straps is also very easy.There are a lot of watch faces available through the boAt Wave app, just download your favourite and install it.

Also there‚Äôs a big synchronisation problem between my phone and the watch, half the times I don‚Äôt get call alerts and message notifications..I have to disconnect and reconnect via Bluetooth and then it works for sometime and same thing repeats.. This is my 3rd watch which I purchased from Amazon (noise and fire boltt) and I returned the first 2 because they had different kind of issues but this has been learning that if you really want to buy a smartwatch then spend some more money and get an Apple Watch because with budget watches you will always face some or the other issue..I have compromised with this watch because I really have no patience left to run behind Amazon to return this","Reviewed in India on 17 March 2022","Disappointed with the functionality of the watch",2,"",0,"Deep Blue"

My treadmill data and watch data readings are very much apart.3. I have a feeling that some of the  readings are not true measurements but some software generated figures.3. Call and Msg alert is erratic. Even though  I do the setting , alerts accuracy  is not 100%.4. Watch wakes up when you move your hand on bed during sleep. Room suddenly lights up...5.

"ROR00NKTLGZ06","Praveen","It was ~2012 when I got my first digital watch. Sony Ericsson had launch this new watch in the US, which could sync with your android phone to give you all the digital experience. I liked it then for its novelty. It had a good touch screen and gave notifications for messages, fb, calls, etc. Had alarm, timer and all other features you'd expect now from a digital watch.Yesterday when I received the boat xtend watch, I relived the same experience. Except for the heart rate sensor and activities tracker, I do not think there's anything new that could really excite me.Animations - screen transitions, etc. are slow and look very rudimentary.Other than heart rate and activity tracker, everything else it does is very basic.The battery kept draining while I finished setup and checked the heart rate monitor and spo2 monitor around 5 times. Came down from a full 100% to 45%.Wake gesture is very pickey and sometimes need to give a second go at it for the display to show up. And you need to wait for 1 to 2 secs for the display to wake up.Maybe it's just me and I don't have a liking for this trend, but people at boat could have atleast given a stainless steel buckle instead of a cheap looking plastic-y one.

Boat claims that the watch can be used at 5 atm water pressure for upto 30 mins.However, this claim by the company is completely fraudulent. The watch lost all functionality within minutes of its first exposure to water. My son just dipped it in water for some time, and the touchscreen stopped responding thereafter, as can be seen in the video. It just goes to prove that the watch is not water resistant at all, and the company is either just making a false claim about it, or the manufacturing/ quality control processes of the company are extremely poor. Any which way, it just shows the company in a very poor light.This is exactly how people loose faith in companies, and companies end up loosing customer base.

"R3BU5OHBNEBIT8","Rohit","Pros: Good battery life and good looks (when screen not on)Cons:1. The display is not at all colorful. It is so dull that it actually makes you dislike the watch. C'mon that's the least expectation from a 4k watch. Display is really really dull and bad.2. Doesn't connect to Google Fit. Well, it does in theory but the steps taken in watch won't ever be updated in your Google fit account. So if you've taken insurance and get discounts with steps taken (my agenda), it doesn't fullfill that agenda.3. Steps count are inaccurate and doesn't match at times. The app keeps logging out and when you log back in, it mismatches the steps4. I wore it at night to check my sleep, and I couldn't find any record in the app next morning. In fact, it is still showing only one day sleep recorded on July 8th for 3 hours. Guess I'm a sleepless zombie now..Verdict: Don't go for this clock.

"R1POW6QLQFYX84","Prathmesh","Pros : Does everything it says in description. So read all of it carefully as we can't try it and ask for refund for electronic items as per new policies.Cons : 1: When we receive a call we can only see whos calling and cut the call thats all. we can't pick the call from watch, thats what smart watches are also meant for.2: Steps meter works on GPS i guess , when i travel on bike it counts every step so isn't accurate that way.3: Alexa only does stuff that is listed in description so don't bother asking it to call someone and most of times it doesn't understand as well.4: you can't voice activate alexa you need to press the button or swipe to talk to alexa.I gifted this to myself on my birthday thinking it will help me but nevermind. It looks great and all but I'm not satisfied.Can't return as well because of the new policies.Every product I'll buy on Amazon I'll clear my doubts with customer care. I suggest you all to do the same.Thankyou.","Reviewed in India on 27 October 2021","Great watch but needs more features for a smart watch.",2,"",0,"Sandy Cream"

"R3P6ZS967CYXJJ","Amazon Customer","My several calls and below email to Boat team resulted in nothing. Please do not buy Boat watches. Its waste of money..My query is with regards to a Boat extend watch which was purchased on 1st of May. Within couple of weeks of the purchase I realised that the watch displayed the saved contacts on my mobile as ""unknown"". I raised this ticket number with your customer service centre who initiated a replacement. An upgraded watch was received in June however the issue wasn't solved. To add more problems the watch that was purchased initially was a Charcoal black however it was replaced with Pitch Black which i didn't want. The customer care rep said there was no inventory, however at the same time Charcoal Black was readily available on Amazon.  In this watch too the saved contacts are displayed as unknown. Your customer care people said that there was an update to be released which would solve this issue by June 25th. I tried calling your customer care since I am still facing the same issues on June 27th. All 3 calls went blank without your reps providing any solution. If I pay 3500 for a watch I expect some kind of courtesy and solution.

If you have burnt 100 cal ( from 9am to 10am) and ( between 10 to 11 no activities) thn during 11 am to 12 pm if you burn another 100 cal the synced Google fir cal burnt will be 300 because the app sent the 100 call for 10am thn it goes and sync again with total cal burnt at 12pm again which 200cal....

Overall I'm not satisfied with product and it's in my bag currently,  switched off. The battery doesn't last long. It works only for 3-4 days.
